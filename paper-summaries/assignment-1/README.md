## Assignment Overview
This is the first paper summary assignment for MAI 5201. You will read the seminal 1966 ELIZA paper by Joseph Weizenbaum and submit a critical analysis addressing the three key questions outlined in the main paper-summaries README.

## Historical Context
ELIZA was one of the first chatbot programs and demonstrated early techniques in natural language processing. Despite being a relatively simple pattern-matching system, ELIZA was remarkably effective at creating the illusion of understanding, leading to important discussions about artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and the nature of communication.

## Submission Instructions
1. Read the paper thoroughly: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/p36-weizenabaum.pdf
2. Create a file named `[your-name].md` in the `paper-summaries/assignment-1/submissions` directory
3. Follow the format and requirements specified in the main README
4. Submit via Pull Request by July 29, 2025 @ 11:59 PM (GYD)

## Key Questions to Consider
As you read, think about:
- How does ELIZA's approach compare to modern chatbots and LLMs?
- What were the technological and computational constraints of 1966?
- Why was ELIZA so effective at convincing users of its "intelligence"?
- What ethical questions does Weizenbaum raise about AI and human interaction?
